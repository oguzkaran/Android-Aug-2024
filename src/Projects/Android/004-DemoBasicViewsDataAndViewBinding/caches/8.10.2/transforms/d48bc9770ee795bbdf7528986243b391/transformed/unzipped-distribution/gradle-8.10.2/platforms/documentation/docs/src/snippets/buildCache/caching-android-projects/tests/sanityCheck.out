The Configuration.fileCollection(Spec) method has been deprecated. This is scheduled to be removed in Gradle 9.0. Use Configuration.getIncoming().artifactView(Action) with a componentFilter instead. Consult the upgrading guide for further information: https://docs.gradle.org/0.0.0/userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#deprecate_filtered_configuration_file_and_filecollection_methods
