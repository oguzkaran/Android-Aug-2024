= View and Debug Dependencies

Gradle provides tooling to navigate dependency graphs and mitigate link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell[dependency hell].
Users can render the full graph of dependencies as well as identify the selection reason and origin for a dependency.
Dependencies can originate through build script declared dependencies or transitive dependencies.
You can visualize dependencies with:

- the built-in Gradle CLI `dependencies` task
- the built-in Gradle CLI `dependencyInsight` task
- link:https://scans.gradle.com/[build scans]

[[sec:listing_dependencies]]
== List Project Dependencies

Gradle provides the built-in `dependencies` task to render a dependency tree from the command line.
By default, the dependency tree renders dependencies for all <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations,configurations>> within a <<command_line_interface#executing_tasks_in_multi_project_builds,single project>>.
The dependency tree indicates the selected version of each dependency.
It also displays information about dependency conflict resolution.

The `dependencies` task can be especially helpful for issues related to transitive dependencies.
Your build file lists direct dependencies, but the `dependencies` task can help you understand which transitive dependencies resolve during your build.

NOTE: Graph of dependencies <<tutorial_using_tasks.adoc#sec:build_script_external_dependencies, declared in the `buildscript` `classpath` configuration>> can be rendered using <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:listing_project_dependencies, task `buildEnvironment`>>.

=== Output Annotations

The `dependencies` task marks dependency trees with the following annotations:

- `(*)`: Indicates repeated occurrences of a transitive dependency subtree. Gradle expands transitive dependency subtrees only once per project; repeat occurrences only display the root of the subtree, followed by this annotation.
- `(c)`: This element is a <<dependency_constraints.adoc#sec:direct-vs-transitive-deps,dependency constraint>>, not a dependency. Look for the matching dependency elsewhere in the tree.
- `(n)`: A dependency or dependency configuration that <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:resolvable-consumable-configs,cannot be resolved>>.

=== Specify a Dependency Configuration

To focus on the information about one dependency configuration, provide the optional parameter `--configuration`.
Just like <<command_line_interface#sec:name_abbreviation, project and task names>>, Gradle accepts abbreviated names to select a dependency configuration.
For example, you can specify `tRC` instead of `testRuntimeClasspath` if the pattern matches to a single dependency configuration.
Both of the following examples show dependencies in the `testRuntimeClasspath` dependency configuration of a Java project:

----
> gradle -q dependencies --configuration testRuntimeClasspath
----

----
> gradle -q dependencies --configuration tRC
----

To see a list of all the configurations available in a project, including those added by any plugins, you can run a `resolvableConfigurations` report.

For more info, see that plugin's documentation (for instance, the Java Plugin is documented <<java_plugin.adoc#sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management,here>>).

=== Example

Consider a project that uses the link:https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/[JGit library] to execute Source Control Management (SCM) operations for a release process.
You can declare dependencies for external tooling with the help of a <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations,custom dependency configuration>>.
This avoids polluting other contexts, such as the compilation classpath for your production source code.

The following example declares a custom dependency configuration named "scm" that contains the JGit dependency:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/inspectingDependencies-dependenciesReport/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependency-declaration]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/inspectingDependencies-dependenciesReport/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependency-declaration]"]
====


Use the following command to view a dependency tree for the `scm` dependency configuration:

----
> gradle -q dependencies --configuration scm
include::{snippetsPath}/dependencyManagement/inspectingDependencies-dependenciesReport/tests/dependencyReport.out[]
----

[[sec:identifying_reason_dependency_selection]]
== Identify the Dependency Version Selected

A project may request two different versions of the same dependency either directly or transitively.
Gradle applies <<dependency_resolution.adoc#sec:version-conflict,version conflict resolution>> to ensure that only one version of the dependency exists in the dependency graph.
The following example introduces a conflict with `commons-codec:commons-codec`, added both as a direct dependency and a transitive dependency of JGit:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/inspectingDependencies-dependencyInsightReport/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependency-declaration]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/inspectingDependencies-dependencyInsightReport/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependency-declaration]"]
====

The dependency tree in a link:https://scans.gradle.com/[build scan] shows information about conflicts.
Click on a dependency and select the "Required By" tab to see the selection reason and origin of the dependency.

=== Dependency Insights

Gradle provides the built-in `dependencyInsight` task to render a  _dependency insight report_ from the command line.
Dependency insights provide information about a single dependency within a single <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations,configuration>>.
Given a dependency, you can identify the selection reason and origin.

`dependencyInsight` accepts the following parameters:

`--dependency <dependency>` (mandatory)::
The dependency to investigate.
You can supply a complete `group:name`, or part of it.
If multiple dependencies match, Gradle generates a report covering all matching dependencies.
`--configuration <name>` (mandatory)::
The dependency configuration which resolves the given dependency.
This parameter is optional for projects that use the <<java_plugin#java_plugin, Java plugin>>, since the plugin provides a default value of `compileClasspath`.
`--single-path` (optional)::
Render only a single path to the dependency.
`--all-variants` (optional)::
Render information about all variants, not only the selected variant.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to run a dependency insight report for all paths to a dependency named "commons-codec" within the "scm" configuration:

----
> gradle -q dependencyInsight --dependency commons-codec --configuration scm
include::{snippetsPath}/dependencyManagement/inspectingDependencies-dependencyInsightReport/tests/dependencyInsightReport.out[]
----

For more information about configurations, see the <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations,dependency configuration documentation>>.

==== Selection Reasons

The "Selection reasons" section of the dependency insight report lists the reasons why a dependency was selected.
Have a look at the table below to understand the meaning of the different terms used:

.Terminology
[%header%autowidth,compact]
|===
| Reason    | Meaning

| (Absent)
| No reason other than a reference, direct or transitive, was present.

| Was requested : <text>
| The dependency appears in the graph, and the inclusion came with a <<declaring_dependencies#sec:documenting-dependencies, `because` text>>.

| Was requested : didn't match versions <versions>
| The dependency appears with a <<dynamic_versions#sub:declaring_dependency_with_dynamic_version, dynamic version>> which did not include the listed versions.
May be followed by a `because` text.

| Was requested : reject version <versions>
| The dependency appears with a <<rich_versions#rich-version-constraints, rich version>> containing one or more `reject`.
May be followed by a `because` text.

| By conflict resolution : between versions <version>
| The dependency appeared multiple times, with different version requests.
This resulted in <<dependency_resolution#sec:version-conflict, conflict resolution>> to select the most appropriate version.

| By constraint
| A <<dependency_constraints#sec:adding-constraints-transitive-deps, dependency constraint>> participated in the version selection.
May be followed by a `because` text.

| By ancestor
| There is a <<rich_versions#rich-version-constraints, rich version>> with a `strictly` which enforces the version of this dependency.

| Selected by rule
| A <<resolution_rules#resolution_rules, dependency resolution rule>> overruled the default selection process.
May be followed by a `because` text.

| Rejection : <version> by rule because <text>
| A `ComponentSelection.reject` link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentSelection.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentSelection:reject(java.lang.String)[rejected the given version] of the dependency.

| Rejection: version <version>: <attributes information>
| The dependency has a dynamic version and some versions did not match the <<variant_model#sec:variant-aware-matching, requested attributes>>.

| Forced
| The build enforces the version of the dependency through an enforced platform or resolution strategy.
|===

If multiple selection reasons exist, the insight report lists all of them.

== Troubleshooting

[[sec:resolving-version-conflict]]
=== Version Conflicts

If the selected version does not match your expectation, Gradle offers a series of tools to help you <<dependency_constraints.adoc#dependency-constraints,control transitive dependencies>>.

[[sec:resolving-variant-aware-errors]]
=== Variant Selection Errors

Sometimes a selection error happens at the <<variant_model.adoc#understanding-variant-selection,variant selection level>>.
Have a look at the <<variant_model.adoc#sec:variant-select-errors,dedicated section>> to understand these errors and how to resolve them.

[[sub:resolving-unsafe-configuration-resolution-errors]]
=== Unsafe Configuration Resolution Errors

Resolving a configuration can have side effects on Gradle's project model.
As a result, Gradle must manage access to each project's configurations.
There are a number of ways a configuration might be resolved unsafely.
For example:

* A task from one project directly resolves a configuration in another project in the task's action.
* A task specifies a configuration from another project as an input file collection.
* A build script for one project resolves a configuration in another project during evaluation.
* Project configurations are resolved in the settings file.

Gradle produces a deprecation warning for each unsafe access.
Unsafe access can cause indeterminate errors.
You should <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:command_line_warnings,fix unsafe access warnings>> in your build.

In most cases, you can resolve unsafe accesses by creating a cross-project dependency on the other project.
See the documentation for <<cross_project_publications.adoc#cross_project_publications, sharing outputs between projects>> for more information.

If you find a use case that can't be resolved using these techniques, please let us know by filing a https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues[GitHub Issue].
